This is our first feature complete release of the WildFly gRPC feature pack üçæüéâüçª. 
Lots of new features, bug fixes and dependency upgrades went into this release. 

### Added

- Add the io.grpc module as it will be removed from WildFly (#78)
- Add to documentation

- Add version for galleon-maven-plugin
- Add configuration parameters
- Add examples/helloworld/client/src/main/resources/client.keystore.pem
- Add attribute: shutdown-timeout
- Add SSL options to chat example

### Changed

- Migrate to using the `org.wildfly.tools:wildfly-parent` for the parent module (#87)
- Enable provisioning for the examples instead of relying on a server built in the test suite. Remove the standalone.xml.* pre-configured files in favor of using CLI to configure servers. (#91)
- Update documentation

### Fixed

- Adjust release script

### Removed
